              <span class="dropcap">T</span> he city of Athens has never been exclusively local. It has always been growing and sustaining itself on the unique population that resides in the city and their needs.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Today, the population of Athens has grown to over <a href="https://www.census.gov/">120,000 residents</a>. Yet, despite over 140 retail stores, chains and residential building across town, it would seem that the city hasn't been changing dramatically or losing its charm. It's been adapting to the growing population and their tastes.</p>

            <p class="bottompp">Shreya Shah, a senior studying English Literature at the University of Georgia, explains.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">"The stores in downtown reflect the taste of the people living in the city,” Shah said. “It gives people a sense of comfort to see familiar stores downtown where they can go shop."</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Indeed, with Athens being a college town that houses thousands of students from multiple cultures and nationalities, the city is bound to change and cater to the crowd it serves.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">While the recent economic growth has resulted in the closure of some local shops, it has also impacted stores downtown in a positive way. The Red Dress Boutique, located on College Avenue, is a prime example of local success.</p>
            
             <!-- Insert Red Dress Boutique store pic here -->
            
            <p class="paragraph">Opened in 2005, Red Dress Boutique has <a href="http://sharktankblog.com/business/red-dress-boutique/">grown exponentially</a> in its time downtown. Featured on Shark Tank for its innovative approach to shopping small, its founder, Diana Harbour, was named a <a href="http://onlineathens.com/business/2015-01-24/red-dress-founder-named-2015-enterprising-woman-year">2015 leading female entrepreneur by Enterprising Women magazine</a> after finishing up the year with more than $14 million in revenue — proof that small businesses can succeed and don’t have to be small</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Despite the change, Athens residents still have the power and say in local politics on what or should or should not be in their city.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">According to Dr. Martin, due to zoning laws, some stores in downtown need special permits to open up. These permits are selected on a case-by-case basis and are held with public hearings. Locals can attend these hearings and voice their concerns to the local government, which can influence whether they provide permits to certain stores or zones.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">  "The local community is very passionate about what they do and don't want in their downtown." Moore said. "We have a very engaged and informed citizen group and a very passionate citizen group. It speaks to our citizen's level of engagement in the process, which is a good thing."
