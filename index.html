Built as the new home of the CED in 2012, the Jackson Street Building sits on the cusp of a ridge that slopes down and opens out to rolling hills, flat lands and the North Oconee River.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Melissa Tufts, director of the Owens Library and the Circle Gallery at the CED, whose office sits on the edge of that stellar view, feels inspired by what she gets to see everyday. “As somebody interested in design, it's asking you to look out and to expand your horizons,” she says.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Yet, for Mrs.Tufts and the rest of downtown Athens, those horizons are changing.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">“My horizons, just four years ago, did not include any of those apartments,” said Mrs.Tufts, motioning to the apartment buildings and condos that now litter her office view. “I mean, I can see through the lovely parking deck, which as parking decks go, that's a nice parking deck. But now, you can see the buildings that are going up in the old Armstrong and Dobbs site.”</p>

            <p class="bottomp">The site Mrs.Tufts is referring to, located a few blocks from where East Broad Street and Oconee Street intersect, was home to Armstrong and Dobbs, a local, family owned building supply company that was in business from 1951 to 2008. Today, that land is being transformed into <a href="http://themarkathens.landmark-properties.com/new-university-student-apartments-athens-ga/">The Mark</a>, a student focused apartment complex that, according to the company’s website, will reach, “a higher standard of luxury living.” While students will soon be reveling in amenities such as a golf simulator, rooftop pool and a self-serve Starbucks coffee bar, The Mark highlights a growing trend currently happening in downtown Athens: the construction of high-rise buildings and an increased presence of national stores and businesses.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">This trend should not be a surprise to anyone. Indeed, downtown Athens has been in a delicate, economic dance between small, locally owned businesses and large, national brands for over 40 years.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">However, recent developments, such as The Mark, and an influx of retail stores, like Urban Outfitters, have raised serious questions on whether this decades long, economic dance is finally reaching its end or is simply moving on to the next act.</p>

                <span class="dropcap">E</span> dward Wilde came to Athens, Georgia in 1972 with his wife, who had been accepted to graduate school at the University of Georgia. Mr.Wilde, pronounced <i>will-dee</i>, got a job at the UGA library, where he stayed for five years. He then found work at a restaurant downtown, which eventually led to him buying into the restaurant. “Since then, since 1977, I've been involved with businesses downtown as a landlord or a business owner,” said Mr.Wilde. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">As a result, Mr.Wilde has built up a very impressive list of properties in downtown Athens. In addition to owning all of 260 North Jackson Street, Mr.Wilde also owns part of the buildings for The Globe and <a href="http://lastresortgrill.com">The Last Resort</a>.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Due to Mr.Wilde’s long presence in downtown, and living in Athens for 45 years, the landlord and business owner keenly remembers the economic shifts that have occurred in the Classic City. “The first big shift was the opening of the Georgia Square Mall in 1981,” says Mr.Wilde. “The big anchor department stores downtown, like Sears, Penny's, Davidson's, moved out to the mall. And people said, 'That's the end of downtown.'”</p>

            <p class="bottomp">It was, in reality, not the end of downtown Athens. Even before the Georgia Square Mall opened, entrepreneurs, bar owners and restaurateurs had begun to open places in downtown Athens because, according to Mr.Wilde, storefronts had fair and reasonable prices. “The mall opening was a reflection of the economic change in downtown Athens,” said Mr.Wilde.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Today, that economic change has created a home for over 90 bars and restaurants, 40 retail locations and a slew of other national and local businesses. Yet, within the last three years, locally owned stores, such as Jackson Street Books, <a href="http://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/jackson-street-books-says-goodbye-after-three-decades/article_081c4062-b5ba-11e5-97f2-7f75f7be16d5.html">have shuttered their doors</a>. In their stead, large retail stores, such as J.Crew, and tall, high-rise buildings, such as Georgia Heights, have poured in, with no sign of stopping.

            <p class="bottomp">The Mark, in particular, is leaving a sour taste on the city for some locals, like Mrs.Tufts, who see’s the soon-to-be-ready, 900 plus room apartment complex as a wasted opportunity. “The developer did not respect the natural processes, the trees, the hydrology, it’s all extremely engineered,” said Mrs.Tufts. “How much more interesting and exciting had they respected the lay of the land and incorporated trees, they could have done some amazing terracing, with beautiful views to the river.”</p>

I think our population base is getting to the point that we are attractive to commercial retailers or commercial and retailers from outside of Athens-Clarke county.”

                <p class="paragraph">This recent spurt in the population increase and the changing demographics of Athens may be responsible for the increase in commercialization, but according to Mr. Moore, this commercialization has not happened recently or over the last few years. “Athens traditionally has seen slow and steady growth in commercial sector, population wise,” says Mr.Moore. “I think that commercialization has not necessarily occurred in the last ten years or so. It has been a natural progression.” Mr.Wilde agrees, noting that not only are more people living in downtown Athens, the current population growth will, “have some effect on the character of downtown in terms of what kind of business thrive.”</p>

            <p class="bottompp">Though the number of retail stores that have opened up in Athens over the last few years may shock local residents, there’s no denying that it has been an economic boom for Athens. Indeed, retail is now the third largest economic driver in the county. This growth, compounded with Athens’ tourism and large football fan base, has help create a very healthy local economy. “Healthy commercial and retail sector is a good thing,” explains Moore. “Being that we are a major importer of tourism and the great things that we are doing at the University and the Classic Center, where people coming into town and spending money, more opportunity they have to do that the better.”</p>
