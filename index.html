Built as the new home of the CED in 2012, the Jackson Street Building sits on the cusp of a ridge that slopes down and opens out to rolling hills, flat lands and the North Oconee River.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Melissa Tufts, director of the Owens Library and the Circle Gallery at the CED, whose office sits on the edge of that stellar view, feels inspired by what she gets to see everyday. “As somebody interested in design, it's asking you to look out and to expand your horizons,” she says.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Yet, for Mrs.Tufts and the rest of downtown Athens, those horizons are changing.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">“My horizons, just four years ago, did not include any of those apartments,” said Mrs.Tufts, motioning to the apartment buildings and condos that now litter her office view. “I mean, I can see through the lovely parking deck, which as parking decks go, that's a nice parking deck. But now, you can see the buildings that are going up in the old Armstrong and Dobbs site.”</p>

            <p class="bottomp">The site Mrs.Tufts is referring to, located a few blocks from where East Broad Street and Oconee Street intersect, was home to Armstrong and Dobbs, a local, family owned building supply company that was in business from 1951 to 2008. Today, that land is being transformed into <a href="http://themarkathens.landmark-properties.com/new-university-student-apartments-athens-ga/">The Mark</a>, a student focused apartment complex that, according to the company’s website, will reach, “a higher standard of luxury living.” While students will soon be reveling in amenities such as a golf simulator, rooftop pool and a self-serve Starbucks coffee bar, The Mark highlights a growing trend currently happening in downtown Athens: the construction of high-rise buildings and an increased presence of national stores and businesses.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">This trend should not be a surprise to anyone. Indeed, downtown Athens has been in a delicate, economic dance between small, locally owned businesses and large, national brands for over 40 years.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">However, recent developments, such as The Mark, and an influx of retail stores, like Urban Outfitters, have raised serious questions on whether this decades long, economic dance is finally reaching its end or is simply moving on to the next act.</p>

Mr.Wilde, pronounced <i>will-dee</i>, got a job at the UGA library, where he stayed for five years. He then found work at a restaurant downtown, which eventually led to him buying into the restaurant. “Since then, since 1977, I've been involved with businesses downtown as a landlord or a business owner,” said Mr.Wilde. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">As a result, Mr.Wilde has built up a very impressive list of properties in downtown Athens. In addition to owning all of 260 North Jackson Street, Mr.Wilde also owns part of the buildings for The Globe and <a href="http://lastresortgrill.com">The Last Resort</a>.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Due to Mr.Wilde’s long presence in downtown, and living in Athens for 45 years, the landlord and business owner keenly remembers the economic shifts that have occurred in the Classic City. “The first big shift was the opening of the Georgia Square Mall in 1981,” says Mr.Wilde. “The big anchor department stores downtown, like Sears, Penny's, Davidson's, moved out to the mall. And people said, 'That's the end of downtown.'”</p>
            
             <p class="paragraph">It was, in reality, not the end of downtown Athens. Even before the Georgia Square Mall opened, entrepreneurs, bar owners and restaurateurs had begun to open places in downtown Athens because, according to Mr.Wilde, storefronts had fair and reasonable prices. “The mall opening was a reflection of the economic change in downtown Athens,” said Mr.Wilde.</p>
